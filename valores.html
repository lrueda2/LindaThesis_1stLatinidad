<div class="Valores1">“When I made the decision to come to the United States to study, my father told me, “If you ever decide this is not for you or things don’t work out, come back home.” But I was not turning back. In my mind, America was the best place in the whole world (my small world, at least) and I knew back then I belonged in the United States.”
  <span class="tooltiptext">
    <p>"My parents never believed that I would make it this far because I wasn't strong and smart. They had found their perfect son in law for me to marry when I came back home as a failure." -V.V</p>
    <p>"I came to America to break my curse that my past ancestors made. I don't want to come back home without completing my dreams and achieving my goals. I may be different from others, but I know I came here for a reason and I'm willing to work hard for it." -M.A</p>
    <p>"My parents made a bet with me that I would give up my dream and move back home to Guatemala. It's been 6 years and I’m still living in Chicago and my parents are so proud of me that they visit me." -T.Y</p>
    <p>"I always wanted to be an architect and I know that Chicago is well known for being one of the most beautiful cities. Mostly, famous buildings by famous architects. My parents, on the other hand, did not support me and wanted me to stay in Mexico to be a doctor, which I came from a family of doctors. Once I left my motherland, my parents told me that I’m welcome to come back to medical school. Now I’m doing my master's and an internship, I’m living the best life." -Y.L</p>
    <p>"Coming from a poor town in Mexico and parents that have no education, it was very hard for me to navigate in the big city on my own. I was scared at first because I had no idea what I was getting into, and I had no support from my parents. It has been 2 years since I left my motherland and they assume that I’m struggling because they keep asking me if I am coming back home." -K.M</p>
    <p>"Coming to America has always been a dream of mine since I was a child. It’s a big deal for me to have taken this opportunity and to make it big. Coming from a low class family with no education, they know this is a big change and risky because I’m going on my own. I know my parents are very concerned about my safety, but I don’t want to give up by turning back." -O.L</p>

<div class="Valores2">“Latino families are close-knit and almost never refer to nuclear families only, but to extended families as well. Since we are close we tend to live in the same city or region. It is uncommon for family members to move to another region or country.”
  <span class="tooltiptext">
    <p>"On decision day, I decided to go to my dream school, which was out of the state. My parents were very hesitant because They don’t know any family members who live in the state that my school was in. I did not care that I’m going to live in New York for 4 years alone. I want to explore and meet new people, it’s part of growing up." -A.E</p>
    <p>"I'm just one state away from my hometown, and few of my family members turn their backs on me. They see me as a traitor just because I go to an out of state school. My family doesn’t see that I worked hard to get where I am at and they see me as selfish. I see their true colors and I’m glad that I know who the backstabbers are." -M.V</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>"Me and my best friend planned to go to the same school. My best friend is white, so it was easy for her parents to be very supportive and understanding. Meanwhile, my parents aren’t very understanding and supportive of me. I even told them that I’m not alone because I’m going with my best friend, but they want me to go somewhere that I can associate with family members." -R.G</p>
    <p>"I always wanted to leave my small town because I’m bored of it. Especially since most of my relatives live in the same town as me. We’re very tight, we have a reunion every weekend, and no one has missed a reunion. I was the first to break the tradition because I want to follow my own path. I know I’m on my own, which is fine because I’m an outgoing person. I already made friends that aren’t my cousins." -D,H</p>
    <p>"When I told my parents about me going to this school, which was an out of state school. They were against me because they did not want me to be seperated from them. I understand that they have to leave everything behind when they come to America for a better life, which is a huge sacrifice. They should see that I’m ready to go on my own path, even if I have to go alone." -S.F</p>

<div class="Valores3">“Latinos have the moral responsibility of helping other family members in need by loaning money, offering their house as a place to live, or taking care of a sick person, for example. Support and security among the extended family is the backbone of Hispanic family values.”
  <span class="tooltiptext">
    <p>“I’m away from home and living in the big city is very expensive. Especially that my parents, who are living in Guatemala, think I’m well off because I’m in America. They keep asking for money, which at times annoys me because I have 2 other siblings. I guess they asked me the most because I’m the oldest and only one living in America.” -B.A</p>
    <p>“I've been living in New York since I graduated from college. Everything was going great until my parents demanded that I take care of my little sister, who was coming to New York for college. At first, I thought it would be a good opportunity for my sister to get a better education. It's only been 2 months since she's been with me and she’s a pain in the butt. She just uses me for money and goes to too many parties. I have never seen her doing any work that was school related. I called my mom to tell her what my little sister was doing, but my mom said that it’s now my responsibility to watch over my little sister.” -L.G</p>
    <p>“One time, my tia(aunt), who I hated so much because of her attitude, had to stay over at my house because my mom told me that she just got a divorce from her husband and needed a place to stay until she found a job. It's been a year and she's just a couch potato.” -R.M</p>
    <p>“Ever since I got a job during my freshman year of high school, my parents began asking for money to help them pay the essentials, such as rent, food, bills, etc. Now I have a family of my own and trying to provide for my own little family needs and helping my parents at the same time is hard. Especially since my wife doesn’t bother looking for a part time job.” -I.K</p>
    <p>“I never really got to know my little sister because she was born when I left the country for school. It was 2 years ago that I got the call from my parents to come back home because my little sister needed support because she was very ill. I had to leave everything behind and help my sick sister. At least I got really close to her and I see that being on her side really helped her recover. I’m back to America, but I still manage to keep in contact with my sister.” -J.F</p>

<div class="Valores4">“Respecting our elders is a part of Hispanic family values. To disrespect someone older than you is considered a dishonor, lack of education, and a result of bad parenting.”
  <span class="tooltiptext">
    <p>“I know my parents told me to respect my elders, but I hate how my parents won’t stand up or take my side. My tias talk shit about me just for no reason so much that she lost my respect for her. One time my tia wanted to talk down to me, but I had enough of her nonsense that I got the courage to talk back to her. My mom was embarrassed that I talked back to my tia, but I did not care because since that day she stopped messing with me. If my mom doesn’t want to stand up for me, I had to do it for myself” -L.P</p>
    <p>“Every family gathering, you have to greet every single one in the gathering. Even if there were some tios and tias that I dislike, I still have to be politie to them. I just put on a fake smile and shake their hand. In my head, I was just picturing myself flicking them off.” -E.Y</p>
    <p>“I still can’t forgive my dad for cheating on my mom with another woman. What is even more weird is that my mom still invites him to family gatherings as he brings along the mistress. My younger sibling still hugs him as they’re hoping that my dad comes back home. I, on the other hand, know that he isn’t coming back home. I just roll my eyes and walk away from him. My mom tried to convince me to greet him, but she doesn’t understand that I can’t forgive him for what he had caused which broke up my family.” -G.M</p>
    <p>“My parents always told me to greet everyone in family gatherings. Even if there’s strangers that associate with one of my family members, I still have to greet them just to make them feel part of the family. To me, I feel very uncomfortable greeting strangers when I know I won’t talk to them or see them again.” -J.Q</p>
    <p>“Number one rule when it comes to family gatherings is to greet everyone in the area. I remember that my family came an hour late to my cousin quinceanera(sweet 15) and the place was very packed. I believe there were 300 people in the building and greeting everyone took more than an hour. I didn’t get a chance to eat because it was already dancing time.” -W.O</p>
    <p>“As a child, my parents would force me to greet every family member, and even to my uncles that gave me creepy vibes. Now that I’m 15, it is my body, my mind, and my choice to make decisions. My parents were very upset that I decided to not greet my uncles, but I wish they would understand why.” -P.F</p>

<div class="Valores5">“Never listen in on/participate in adult conversations”
  <span class="tooltiptext">
    <p>“I don’t get why my mom doesn’t let me hear her chisme with her friends. Like she forced me to speak Spanish at home, so I can clearly understand what they’re talking about.” -K.O</p>
    <p>“My parents forced me to translate important documents that are in English to Spanish since I was 6 years old, make reservations or phone calls when I was 8 years old, and to count money for them since I was 6 years old. I’m 14 years old and they don’t let me join in the family chisme because I’m not mature or old enough to handle it."" -T.G</p>
    <p>“Translate things that are in English to Spanish for my parents since I was in first grade, and I spoke for real grown ups in English because my parents can’t speak English well. They don’t let me join in the adult conversation during family gatherings. I’m 13 and I’m the only child in every family gathering, in which I have no one to play or talk to.” -M.R</p>
    <p>“My parents can speak Spanish, but they can’t write or read Spanish because they dropped out at a very early age to work in their motherlands. I had to learn to speak, write, and read English and Spanish on my own. I have to write and read important papers whether it’s English or Spanish, but they don’t need me when they have adult conversation with their friends and family.” -X.T</p>

<div class="Valores6">“A big part of the reason these girls are struggling is because they are pulled in conflicting directions. “Their parents want them to adhere to the traditional values of their homeland, while the girls seek to integrate into American culture,” she explains. The result: Parents are often extremely overprotective; they won’t allow their daughters to venture out and participate in activities such as sleepovers, dating or trips to the mall. “That leaves the girls feeling like they are trapped and have no way out, which creates a very dangerous situation.”
  <span class="tooltiptext">
    <p>“My friends don’t understand why I go to a lot of concerts and music festivals. I grew up with strict parents that I had missed out on a lot of fun things that I wished to join. I went to my first live concert when I turned 21. It was amazing but sucks because seeing my favorite artist being retired or pass away means that I did not have a chance to see them live. I just want to enjoy every single moment I have missed out on.” -L.R.R</p>
    <p>“It is not fair that my parents let my little brother go to an out of state school and even it was very expensive with little scholarships. From what I remembered, I got into Yale with a full ride, but my parents forced me not to go or else they would disown me. I’m going to a school that is only 6 miles from home and I’m not even allowed to leave home until I’m married by the man of their choice.” -S.P</p>
    <p>"I’m always the outcast within my home and school. My parents see me as the black sheep because I want to be an American girl. Thanks to them, I lost my friends since they never let me hang out with them or attended their birthday parties. My friends think I’m such a baby for not wanting to leave the house.” -M.U</p>
    <p>“I wanted my parents to understand that I need to live my life. Strict parents create rebellious children. I even sneak out of the house just to go out.” -</p>
    <p>“It is not fair that my parents let my brother go out clubbing, but my parents don’t let me go study in the library. Especially that the library is a block away.” -Z.V</p>
    <p>“Living in a Hispanic household can be overwhelming, not only because I’m a woman but also because I’m the oldest and expected more of. When my mom isn’t here, I have to act as a stand in for her by cooking and cleaning and taking care of my siblings. When I wish to go out, it’s very hard for me to convince my parents, especially since my dad gets the last word.” -D.M</p>
